A group of students and teachers at [St. Mark's](http://www.stmarksschool.org) are working on building a robotic lathe. The lathe is controlled by a computer running a Java application that communicates with the hardware through an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc) [Diecimilla USB card](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDiecimila). The hardware communication uses the [Processing](http://www.processing.org) libraries.
